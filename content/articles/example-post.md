## Who is she?
She flies higher than she’s ever flown before, maybe she is trying to leave the earth. She isn’t sure, she isn’t thinking about it. She’s far in her mind, deep in her own thoughts, the air on her wings feels amazing, she is swimming, rolling through the air as if it’s water. She lifts her head as she flies and lets out a series of loud chirps. And that’s when she sees it. The largest bat ever. Flying faster than any hawk or eagle or owl, roaring like some sort of monster. She doesn’t know the human word ‘dragon’ otherwise she would call it that. There is no time to flee. No time to turn. No time to shriek, and no pain. It is like being thrown into the stars.

A fire-eater must eat fire, even if she has to kindle it herself.

## What is the best life?
Know yourself. You are worth knowing. Examine your life. The unexamined life is not worth living. Be aware that other people have equal significance. Give them the space to make their own choices, and let their choices count as you want them to let your choices count. Remember that excellence has no stopping point and keep on pursuing it. Make art that can last and that says something nobody else can say. Live the best life you can, and become the best self you can. You cannot know which of your actions is the lever that will move worlds. Not even Necessity knows all ends. Know yourself.

## The old site
The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.

```js [example.js]
const http = require('http')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  bodyParser.parse(req, (error, body) => {
    res.end(body)
  })
}).listen(3000)
```

## And now... some basic magic.
